					<h1>heroes</h1>
					<h2>In Dota 2 there are 4 types of attributes- Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Universal. Every hero has all the attributes, however one of the attributes is the hero's main attributes. Therefore, heroes are divided into 4 groups according to their main attribute.</h2>

								<h1>universal </h1>
								<p>Universal heroes in Dota 2 have a balanced combination of attributes, making them versatile in various roles.
