Success relies on teamwork, strategy, and tactical battles as players control lanes, secure objectives, and outmaneuver their opponents.</p>

Players battle through the lanes, fighting for control and pushing towards the enemy base. Each teamâ€™s base is protected by towers and barracks, with the ultimate goal of destroying the enemy's Ancient. The map encourages strategic movement, vision control, and teamwork across its dynamic layout.</p>
